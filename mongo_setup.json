    "title":"Odell Beckham Jr on the Trading Block?",
    "date": "3/26/18",
    "content":"In an NFL offseason that has featured blockbuster trade after blockbuster trade, another star player could be on the block. NFL Media's Ian Rapoport reported on Monday that New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. will not report to training camp absent a new contract. In turn, the Giants are willing to discuss a Beckham trade should they receive the right offer. There's a whole heck of a lot to unearth here, so let's take it step by step. <h2> Beckham's Current Contract </h2><br> The three-time Pro Bowler signed a four-year, $10.4 million deal with New York after the team selected him 12th overall back in 2014. Like all rookie contracts under the current collective bargaining agreement, that came with a fifth-year team option. New York exercised this option last offseason, which means OBJ is set to earn $8.5 million next season. He'll become an unrestricted free agent once the 2018 campaign draws to a conclusion. Beckham's 2018 salary ranks him outside the 20 highest-paid receivers in the NFL. Based on his production in his first three seasons — 288 receptions for 4,122 yards and 35 touchdowns — Beckham is right in concluding that he's underpaid. It's hard to objectively counter that argument. But there are also other variables that have to play a role in New York's decision-making process. <h2> Other Factors </h2><br> Beckham has been fined a whopping 10 times for either violations of the NFL uniform policy or on-field shenanigans, and that has made him an enigmatic figure within the organization. He was also suspended for one game for a blatantly egregious hit on then-Carolina Panthers cornerback Josh Norman in December 2015. Obviously, this has to play a role in the Giants' decision making. Some will conclude that OBJ is passionate about the game. That's fine. But there's a sense that said passion could have an adverse impact on his team moving forward. Off the field, there's that whole Miami boat trip incident during the 2016 NFL Playoffs, which showed a lack of maturity on Beckham's part. At the very least, the Giants could use that as a negotiating tactic in extension talks. We then have the receiver's injury-plagued 2017 campaign, which saw him miss all but four games because of a broken ankle. For someone who relies a ton on his short-area speed, this could potentially be a long-term issue. It could also play a role in contract negotiations. So while Beckham has proved himself to be among the most productive receivers in modern NFL history, there's a lot more to this situation than the difference he makes on the field.",
